# Hubtel instant data — setup

Everything needed to turn `data.html` from "renders, but delivers nothing" into a
live product. Read the blocker section first: as of the last check, step 1 cannot
be completed because the credentials we hold do not authenticate.

---

## 1. Credentials (BLOCKED)

Set the secrets. Do not put these in a repo file, and do not paste them into chat.

```bash
supabase secrets set \
  HUBTEL_CLIENT_ID=... \
  HUBTEL_CLIENT_SECRET=... \
  HUBTEL_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=... \
  HUBTEL_DATA_PURCHASE_URL=... \
  HUBTEL_DATA_BUNDLES_URL=... \
  HUBTEL_DATA_STATUS_URL=...
```

| Secret | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HUBTEL_CLIENT_ID` | yes | Account client id |
| `HUBTEL_CLIENT_SECRET` | yes | Account client secret |
| `HUBTEL_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT` | no | Merchant account number, sent on data calls |
| `HUBTEL_DATA_PURCHASE_URL` | yes | Data purchase endpoint. Without it every purchase is refused before the wallet is touched |
| `HUBTEL_DATA_BUNDLES_URL` | no | Provider bundle catalog, used to map package ids |
| `HUBTEL_DATA_STATUS_URL` | no | Delivery status poll. Without it an order that cannot be confirmed stays `pending` |
| `HUBTEL_TOKEN_URL` | no | OAuth2 token endpoint. When set, `client_credentials` is used; when not, credentials go straight on the request |
| `HUBTEL_AUTH_SCHEME` | no | `basic` (default) or `bearer`, used when there is no token endpoint |
| `HUBTEL_SCOPE` | no | Scope parameter for the token request |
| `HUBTEL_TIMEOUT_MS` | no | Request timeout, default 25000 |

No endpoint URL is hardcoded in `supabase/functions/_shared/hubtelDataProvider.ts`.
Hubtel's developer portal is a login-gated SPA, the public docs disagree with each
other about hosts and auth, and a probe against `payproxyapi.hubtel.com` returned
HTTP 401 for every auth shape tried — including with no `Authorization` header at
all, so those 401s do not even distinguish a wrong key from a wrong auth style. A
URL guessed into the source would be a guess against a live merchant account.

**What we still need from Hubtel:** the data-vending account credentials, the
purchase endpoint, and a status endpoint that answers. Until then the page shows a
"delivery not switched on yet" notice and every purchase is refused with HTTP 503
before any wallet movement.

---

## 2. Deploy

```bash
supabase db push                                    # migration 20261006000000
supabase functions deploy data-catalog
supabase functions deploy purchase-data-bundle
```

`20261006000000_hubtel_data_platform.sql` is queued behind two migrations that
have never been applied to `mxovqblxizvjsmudjsjf`: `20260930100000_agent_referral_store`
and `20261002000000_bundle_catalog`. `supabase db push` applies them in order, so
push all of them or none.

---

## 3. Turn bundles on

Every seeded bundle ships with `is_available = false`. That is deliberate: a bundle
is sellable only once its `hubtel_package_id` is mapped, because an order for an
unmapped bundle cannot be delivered and the customer paid for nothing.

```bash
# 1. See what Hubtel actually offers.
supabase functions invoke list-hubtel-bundles --linked   # not implemented; see below
```

There is no catalog-mapping function yet. Until there is, map the ids by hand from
the Hubtel catalog:

```sql
update public.bundles
   set hubtel_package_id = '<id from hubtel>',
       provider_cost     = <our cost in GHS>,
       is_available      = true,
       unavailable_reason = null
 where bundle_key = 'mtn-1gb';
```

Check what you turned on:

```sql
select network_id, count(*) filter (where is_available) as on_sale, count(*) as total
  from public.bundles
 group by network_id
 order by network_id;
```

Switch one bundle on, buy it, and confirm delivery before switching on the rest.

---

## 4. Named bundles that are not seeded

`Kokrokoo`, `Midnight` and `Voice` bundles are named vendor products. They are not
in the seed because their price and package id can only come from Hubtel, and
inventing a GHS figure would put a price on screen with no cost basis behind it.

Once Hubtel supplies them:

```sql
insert into public.bundles
  (bundle_key, network_id, title, data_amount, volume_mb, price, category,
   validity, hubtel_package_id, provider_cost, is_available, sort_order)
values
  ('mtn-kokrokoo-1gb', 'mtn', 'Kokrokoo 1GB', '1GB (2 days)', 1024, 6.00,
   'Kokrokoo', '2 days', '<hubtel id>', 5.20, true, 95);
```

`volume_mb` is required and is what the order path is denominated in — a display
string is not something to parse. Use `validity` for the duration the provider
actually states; leave it NULL rather than inventing one, because `data-catalog`
passes it straight through and the UI shows it verbatim.

---

## 5. Verify

```bash
# Catalog is world-readable, provider readiness is reported.
curl -s "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/data-catalog" -H "apikey: $ANON" | jq

# An unconfigured provider must refuse without touching a wallet.
curl -s -X POST "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/purchase-data-bundle" \
  -H "apikey: $ANON" -H "Authorization: Bearer <agent jwt>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bundleKey":"mtn-1gb","phone":"0244123456"}' | jq
# expect 503 and no debit
```

Then, end to end with an agent session: buy a small bundle, confirm
`data_transactions.status = 'success'`, confirm the `wallets.balance` fell by
exactly `bundles.price`, and confirm `wallet_transactions` has one debit row for
the same `reference`.

Force a decline to prove the refund path: point `HUBTEL_DATA_PURCHASE_URL` at a
nonexistent path, buy, and confirm the wallet is back to its original balance with
a matching `credit` row and `data_transactions.status = 'failed'`.

---

## 6. Known gap

An order whose provider call never returned stays `pending` with the wallet still
debited, because we cannot tell whether Hubtel received it. Refunding there risks
giving the bundle away; holding the money risks holding it if nothing was ever
delivered. It is logged loudly and reported to the agent as "delivery being
confirmed".

Closing this needs `HUBTEL_DATA_STATUS_URL` plus a reconcile job that polls pending
rows and settles them through `refund_agent_wallet`. That is the next piece of
work on this feature, not a bug to route around.
